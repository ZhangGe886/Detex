# Note

I will be rewriting much of Detex in the coming months. More information to follow.

Update: I am still working Detex, but the focus of the project will probably change bit. I recommend checking out [EQcorrscan](https://github.com/eqcorrscan/eqcorrscan) for your match filter/detection needs.

# Intro

Detex is a python package for performing waveform similarity clustering and [subspace detection](https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/335299.pdf) on seismic data.

Checkout the [documentation](http://d-chambers.github.io/Detex/) if you are interested in learning more about it.
