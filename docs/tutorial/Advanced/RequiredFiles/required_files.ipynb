    "Detex requires two files: the station key and the template key (referred to as \"keys\"). Both are usually saved as csv files for ease of editing/viewing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Station Key\n",
    "\n",
    "The station key is used to tell detex which stations and channels to use. The location of the station and a desired time frame are also included. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example from the introductory tutorial:\n",

If you do use a time stamp be careful when editing outside of python because some programs, like excel, tend to silently round large numbers. See the [obspy.UTCDateTime docs](https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.utcdatetime.UTCDateTime.html) for more info on readable formats. \n",
    "\n",
    "The CHANNELS field lists the channels that will be used for each station. If multiple channels are used they are separated by a dash (-).\n",
    "\n",
    "The LAT, LON, and ELEVATION fields give the stations location in global coordinates (elevation is from sea-level, in meters).\n",

    "\n",
    "As long as the comma separated format shown above is followed you can use any method you like to create the keys. For small data sets it may be suitable to create the keys by hand in a text editor or in a program like open office. For larger data sets, however, it is better to either use some of the built in functions to generate the keys or create your own script to do so. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following shows a few of the built in methods for generating the keys but it is an good learning exercise in python, especially for those new in the language, to generate these files yourself. If you do write a script or function that uses some data source detex currently cannot read consider contributing it to detex as others will probably find it useful.\n",
